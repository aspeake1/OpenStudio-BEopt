This rate is for \"residential use\" for consumers served under a single meter. \"Residential use\" means electric use that is exclusively for domestic purposes (living spaces) but whose use may include service to water pumps, garages, barns or minor outbuildings provided they are served under the same domestic meter whose annual Maximum Demand used is 50 kW or greater. This tariff is optional to consumers whose capacity used is less than 50 kW. Service under this tariff is subject to the established tariffs, rules and regulations of Holy Cross.\n\nThe consumer's Minimum Monthly Charge (which includes a Consumer Charge, a Demand Charge and an Energy Charge) shall not be less than the highest of the following:\n1. The Minimum Monthly Charge specified in the Contract for Electric Service at the service location.\n2. $1.00 per kW per highest Maximum Demand billed in the last 12 months. In the event no demand history is available, Holy Cross shall estimate, using the best means and information available, a maximum kW demand for the service location.\n\nFixed monthly charge: PCA = [(C+T+A)/S] - B\n\nPCA = Generation and Wholesale Power Cost Adjustment Rate Rider (PCA) expressed in $0.00000 per kWh\n\nC = The projected total generation and wholesale power cost in dollars from all sources including Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) computed for the 12 month period.
