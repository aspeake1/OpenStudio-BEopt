Residential electric service is\r\navailable for uses customarily associated with residential occupation, including lighting, cooking, heating,\r\ncooling, refrigeration, household appliances and other domestic purposes.\r\nResidential rates are based on service to single family units and are not applicable to multi-family\r\ndwellings served through a single meter. Where two or more families occupy a residential building,\r\nKenergy may require, as a condition precedent to the application of the residential rate, the wiring in the\r\nbuilding be so arranged as to permit each family to be served through a separate meter. In those cases\r\nwhere such segregation of wiring would involve undue expense to the Member, at the Member's option in\r\nlieu of the foregoing, electric service rendered to a multi-family residential building through a single meter\r\nwill be classified as commercial and billed on the basis of service to a Member at an appropriate nonresidential\r\nrate.\r\nIf a separate meter is used to measure the consumption to remotely located buildings, such as garages,\r\nbarns, pump houses, grain bins or other outbuildings, or facilities, such as electric fences, it will be\r\nconsidered a separate service and be billed as a separate service at the applicable non-residential rate.","source":"http://psc.ky.gov/tariffs/Electric/Kenergy%20Corp/Tariff.pdf","sourceparent":"https://www.kenergycorp.com/rates/","phasewiring":"Single and 3-Phase","flatdemandunit":"kW","demandrateunit":"kW","energyratestructure":[[{"unit":"kWh","rate":0.102038,"adj":0.010435}]],"energyweekdayschedule":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"energyweekendschedule":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"energycomments":"Only able to find the Renewable Resource Energy rider rate in tariff\r\nAdjustments = Fuel Adjustment rider + Environmental Surcharge rider + Unwind Surcredit Adjustment rider + Rebate Adjustment rider\r\n + Member Rate Stability Mechanism rider + Non-FAC Purchased Power Adjustment rider + Rural Economic Reserve Adjustment riderAdjustments = Fuel Adjustment rider + Environmental Surcharge rider + Unwind Surcredit Adjustment rider + Rebate Adjustment rider + Member Rate Stability Mechanism rider + Non-FAC Purchased Power Adjustment rider + Rural Economic Reserve Adjustment rider","fixedmonthlycharge":18.2}]}
