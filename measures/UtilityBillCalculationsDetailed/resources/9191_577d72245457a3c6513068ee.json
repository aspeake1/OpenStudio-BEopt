Service under this pilot schedule is limited to no more than 1,200 metered service points.  The Residential Service Time-of-Day Pilot Plan is an optional, voluntary service that provides residential Customers the option to take electric service with seasonal time-of-day energy rates. If a Customer requests to participate in this pilot schedule, the Customer will be placed on the schedule within seven (7) business days, subject to work constraints. A Customer may terminate their participation on this schedule at any time.  However, the Customer may not subsequently elect service under this schedule for one year after the effective date of cancellation.  If a Customer requests to be taken off of the schedule, the Customer will be removed from the schedule as of the last meter read date.\r\n\r\n*Power Cost Adjustment = ($0.0.01166/kWh)\r\n\r\n*Includes a 4% Energy Efficiency Rider","source":"https://www.idahopower.com/AboutUs/RatesRegulatory/Tariffs/tariffPDF.cfm?id=264","sourceparent":"https://www.idahopower.com/AboutUs/RatesRegulatory/Tariffs/default.cfm?state=id","flatdemandunit":"kW","demandrateunit":"kW","energyratestructure":[[{"unit":"kWh","rate":0.073241,"adj":0.01217664}],[{"unit":"kWh","rate":0.094313,"adj":0.01301952}],[{"unit":"kWh","rate":0.073241,"adj":0.01217664}],[{"unit":"kWh","rate":0.127764,"adj":0.01435756}]],"energyweekdayschedule":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]],"energyweekendschedule":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"energycomments":"Adjustment = Fixed Cost adjustment + Power Cost adjustment + Energy Efficiency rider + Residential and Small Farm Energy Credit","fixedmonthlycharge":5}]}
