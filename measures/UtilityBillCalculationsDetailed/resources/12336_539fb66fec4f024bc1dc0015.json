The base cost of power (U) is $0.0537 per kilowatt-hour. \r\n\r\nParallel Generation (20 kW or less) Net Energy Billing - Available for single-phase and three-phase customers where a part or all of the electrical requirements of the customer are supplied by the customer's generating facilities, where such facilities have a total generating capability of 20 kW or less, where such facilities are connected in parallel with the utility and where such facilities are approved by the utility. Rate: The customer shall be billed monthly on a net energy basis and shall pay the fixed charge and energy charge specified in the rate schedule under which he is served. If, in any month, the customer's bill has a credit balance of $25 or less, the amount shall be credited to subsequent bills until a debit balance is reestablished. If the credit balance is more than $25, the utility shall reimburse the customer by check upon request. Monthly credits shall be computed by taking the net excess kilowatt-hours produced times the sum of the applicable energy charge plus monthly power cost adjustment clause (PCAC).  \r\nThis rate will be applied to residential single-phase customers for ordinary household purposes. Single-phase motors may not exceed 5 horsepower individual-rated capacity without utility permission.\r\n\r\nFixed Monthly Charge includes Commitment to Community Rider:$1.34 per customer per month.","startdate":1211241600,"eiaid":12336,"energyratestructure":[[{"unit":"kWh","rate":0.0733,"adj":0.0537}]],"energyweekdayschedule":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"energyweekendschedule":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"flatdemandunit":"kW","phasewiring":"3-Phase","name":"Rg-1 Residential Service Three Phase","revisions":[1339679847,1339679866,1343153127,1354884550,1402083355,1406712300,1427405188],"sector":"Residential","sourceparent":"http://www.merrillan.net/utilities/electric.htm","source":"www.merrillan.net/utilities/documents/Merrillan_Electric_Utility_Tariffs.pdf","utility":"Village of Merrillan, Wisconsin (Utility Company)","fixedmonthlycharge":11.34}]}
