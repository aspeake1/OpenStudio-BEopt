Applicable and available to residential users at the residential rate.  Applicable and available to persons that live in or occupy single family dwelling units, or houses whether in a form of a house, or multiple apartments when individually metered, used strictly for \"residential\" or \"domestic\" purposes.  Domestic purposes also includes agricultural pursuits where service is taken through one (1) meter primarily for residential purposes and secondary for the usual farm uses outside the home, but it is not extended to operations of a commercial nature or operations such as processing, preparing or distributing products not raised or produced on the farm, unless such operation is incidental to the usual domestic and farm uses.  Is not applicable where more than one (1) dwelling unit (such as an apartment complex or manufactured home park  (mobile home park)) is served through a single meter.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n     Where service is supplied through one (1) meter to an apartment house or multiple dwelling, for billing purposes, the rates will be applied as a single Commercial Customer.  The Customer may arrange Customer's service, at Customer's expense, so as to separate the combined service and permit the Utility to install a separate meter for each individual apartment.  In such cases, each individual apartment shall be billed as a single Residential Customer.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n     Except as may be provided herein, if a residential unit is used for both residential and commercial purposes, the applicable Commercial Service Rates shall apply unless the wiring is so arranged so that the residential usage can be separately metered.  Hallways and other common facilities of an apartment and condominium building or complex will be billed on the Commercial Service Rate when metering is possible.","startdate":1417478400,"eiaid":13209,"energyratestructure":[[{"unit":"kWh","rate":0.0216}]],"energyweekdayschedule":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"energyweekendschedule":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"flatdemandunit":"kW","name":"Residential- Rural","revisions":[1417515275,1417515364,1418641081,1418641130,1427405219],"sector":"Residential","source":"http://www.conwaygreene.com/Napoleon/lpext.dll?f=templates&fn=main-h.htm&2.0","supersedes":"539f6cb7ec4f024411ecad91","utility":"City of Napoleon, Ohio (Utility Company)","fixedmonthlycharge":10}]}
