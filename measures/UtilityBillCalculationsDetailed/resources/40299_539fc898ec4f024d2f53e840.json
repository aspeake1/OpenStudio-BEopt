The rate shall be limited by the availability of appropriate meters and further limited by the percentage of the Cooperative's load served by renewable energy systems and/or impact on the Cooperative's members not utilizing this rate.\n\nThis rate is not available for unoccupied properties. Seasonal use properties may have the maximum size of the system limited by a calculation of a occupied load (see system sizing).
