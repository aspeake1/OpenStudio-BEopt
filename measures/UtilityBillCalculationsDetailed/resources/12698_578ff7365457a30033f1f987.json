The maximum size motor permitted on this rate schedule is ten (10) \r\nhorsepower.  This rate schedule is for single-phase service. \r\nA \"residential\" (\"domestic\") customer under this residential rate classification is a customer who \r\npurchases electricity for \"domestic use.\"  \"Domestic use\" under this rate classification includes that \r\nportion of electricity that is ultimately consumed at a single-family or individually metered multiple-family \r\ndwelling, and shall apply to all such purchases regardless of whether the customer is the ultimate \r\nconsumer. \r\nThis schedule is intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 144.030(23) RSMo by establishing \r\nand maintaining a system and rate classification of \"residential\" to cause the residential sales and \r\npurchases of electricity under this rate schedule to be considered as sales for domestic use. \r\nWhere a portion of a residence unit is used for non-residential purposes, the appropriate \r\ngeneral service schedule is applicable to all  service.  However, if the wiring is arranged so that the \r\nservice for residential purposes and for non-residential purposes can be metered separately, this \r\nschedule will be applied to the residential service.  Service to hotels, recognized rooming or boarding \r\nhouses or to the halls, basement or other common use portions of an apartment building will not be \r\nsupplied under this schedule.","source":"https://www.kcpl.com/~/media/Files/My%20Bill/MO%20Detailed%20Tariffs/GMO_Electric_Rates_Tariffs(042516).pdf","sourceparent":"https://www.kcpl.com/my-bill/for-home/rate-information/mo/residential-rate-overview-gmo-mps","phasewiring":"Single Phase","flatdemandunit":"kW","demandrateunit":"kW","energyratestructure":[[{"max":600,"unit":"kWh","rate":0.1115,"adj":0.00287},{"max":1000,"unit":"kWh","rate":0.1148,"adj":0.00287},{"unit":"kWh","rate":0.1205,"adj":0.00287}],[{"max":600,"unit":"kWh","rate":0.1115,"adj":0.00287},{"max":1000,"unit":"kWh","rate":0.0764,"adj":0.00287},{"unit":"kWh","rate":0.0764,"adj":0.00287}]],"energyweekdayschedule":[[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]],"energyweekendschedule":[[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]],"energycomments":"Adjustments = Demand Side Investment mechanism + Fuel Adjustment clause","fixedmonthlycharge":10.43}]}
